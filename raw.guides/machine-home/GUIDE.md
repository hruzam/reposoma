# Home Machine Capabilities & Configuration

**Machine:** Manjaro (Arch-based)
**Generated:** 2026-06-28
**Last Updated:** 2026-06-28

> ## ⚠ STALE — read with suspicion (flagged 2026-07-29)
>
> This guide predates the **machine-convergence work** (operator, ~2026-05): office was
> reframed to use the same partition layout and the same `~/` home-folder placement as home,
> deliberately, to make the two machines as similar as possible. **Every "home vs office
> difference" claim below is therefore suspect** — most describe a divergence that has since
> been closed, and the doc has not been re-derived.
>
> Two concrete errors already corrected in place (search ⚠ in this file). Assume more remain.
>
> What is still true and where to check instead:
> - **PHP / composer** — a real, current difference. Authoritative split table:
>   `~/.config/zsh/AGENTS.md` §"The PHP / composer machine split".
> - **Project paths** — `ai/temple-project-map.zsh` is the only place physical paths live.
> - **Machine identity / project vars** — office declares them inline in `config.zsh`.
>   The `harness.machine-project-registry.json` mechanism is retired on office and being
>   retired on home; anything in this guide citing it as the source is out of date.
>
> Do not re-derive this guide from office. Home owns it, and it should be regenerated on
> home once the registry migration lands.

## 🐳 Docker Setup

### Current Status
```bash
# Check if installed
which docker

# Check if running
systemctl is-active docker

# Check if user in group
groups | grep docker
```

### Configuration (if needed)
```bash
# Install
sudo pacman -S docker

# Enable and start
sudo systemctl enable --now docker

# Add user to group
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
# Then logout/login for group to take effect
```

### Project-Specific Images
Your projects may require custom Docker images:
- `php74-composer` — For FantasyObchod (PHP 7.4)
- `composer:latest` — Composer for modern PHP projects

The local PHP 7.4 Dockerfile lives at `~/.docker/php74-composer/Dockerfile`.

---

## 🐘 PHP & Composer

### Available Versions

#### Home Setup (uses Docker)
```bash
php74 [args]         # PHP 7.4 CLI via php74-composer Docker image
php8 [args]          # Native system PHP 8+
phpst                # Show Docker/image/native runtime status
composer74 <args>    # Composer 2.2 + PHP 7.4 via Docker
composer8 <args>     # Current Composer image via Docker
```

These keys live in `system/keyboard.zsh`; bodies are in
`system/home.php-composer.zsh`. The keyboard is shared with office, but each host loads
its own engine.

#### Configuration
- **Composer Home:** `~/.composer/`
- **Composer Cache:** `~/.composer/cache/`
- **System Composer:** `/usr/bin/composer`

### Project PHP Requirements

| Project | PHP Version | Framework | Toolkit |
|---------|------------|-----------|---------|
| FantasyObchod (FO) | 7.4 | Custom | `fo-toolkit.zsh` |
| Imago/Freya (IM) | 8.x | Custom | `im-toolkit.zsh` |
| PSDVS | 8.x | Laravel | `psdvs-toolkit.zsh` |
| Laravel Training (LTP) | 8.x | Laravel | `ltp-toolkit.zsh` |

## 🗄️ Database (MariaDB)

### Current Status
```bash
# Check if running
systemctl is-active mariadb

# Start if needed
sudo systemctl start mariadb

# Check version
mariadb --version
```

### Default Credentials
```
User:     majkee
Database: fantasyobchod (for FO project)
```

### Privileges
`majkee`@`localhost` does NOT have `CREATE DATABASE` by default — run as root to grant it:

```sql
-- connect as root: sudo mysql -u root
GRANT CREATE ON *.* TO 'majkee'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

After this, `majkee` can `CREATE DATABASE` without root each time.

### Project Databases
See `~/.config/zsh/harness.machine-project-registry.json` for DB details per project.

### Backup Location
```
ENV_BACKUP_DIR: ~/www/PSDVS/env
```

## 🎯 Machine-Specific Notes

### Home vs Office
This is the **home** machine (`MACHINE_NAME=home`).

Machine differences (⚠ corrected 2026-07-29 — this section previously cited
`harness.machine-project-registry.json` as the source; that mechanism is retired on office
and being retired on home. Office declares these as inline exports in `config.zsh`):
- **Editors:** Sublime Text (home) vs Code (office)
- **Project Paths:** `~/www/` (home) vs ~~`/media/data/projects/`~~ → **`~/projects/`** (office).
  `/media/data/projects` was declared an empty unmounted husk 2026-07-07 and repointed;
  the old value here was stale. Authoritative map: `ai/temple-project-map.zsh`.
- **PHP Binaries:** PHP 7.4 is Docker-based on home; PHP 8+ is native. Both are native and
  both FPM services run concurrently on office.
  See the split table in `~/.config/zsh/AGENTS.md` — office runs `php74-fpm` and `php-fpm`
  simultaneously with nginx socket routing; home invokes a container per composer call.

### Registry Files
- **Machine Registry:** `~/.config/zsh/harness.machine-project-registry.json`
- **AI Agents Registry:** `~/.config/zsh/ai-agents.registry.json`
