## What changed

**(1) `raw.therapy/README.md` line 23**
`New seed files are gaveled by @majkee, not authored by agents.`
→ `New therapy files are gaveled by @majkee, not authored by agents.`

**(2) `nabla-lab/drafts/decentralized-memory-substrate-spec-v2.md` — rename object `scar` → `repulsion edge`**
Scoped exactly to the four locations named in the task, nothing wider:
- §6 list line: `**Scars [v2]:**` → `**Repulsion edges [v2]:**`
- §6.2 heading: `### 6.2 Scars — negative knowledge as first-class [v2]` → `### 6.2 Repulsion edges — negative knowledge as first-class [v2]`
- §8 candidate-contributions bullet: `**Scar as the dual of the tombstone**` → `**Repulsion edge as the dual of the tombstone**`
- §9 one-line summary: `scar what must never be re-walked` → `lay a repulsion edge on what must never be re-walked` (reworded from verb to verb-phrase to keep the sentence grammatical with the new noun)

Added the requested one-line naming note directly under the §6.2 heading:
> *(Naming note: this object was renamed from the earlier "scar" — unrelated to the harness term* scar *used elsewhere, which denotes a de-specified lesson record, raw.incarnations.)*

## Why (and what I deliberately did NOT touch)

The task's parenthetical named exactly four spots (heading, §6 list line, §8, §9) — not the §6.2 body prose (lines 220–232 in the pre-edit file), which still uses "scar"/"Scar"/"scars" repeatedly (the definition paragraph, the tombstone/scar contrast blockquote, the "decay = forgot; scar = remembered-as-wrong" line, and the router-obligation paragraph). I read that as intentional scope — two "one-line vocabulary edits," not a full-document rename — and stayed inside it rather than silently widening the edit.

**Flagging, not fixing:** this now leaves §6.2 internally inconsistent — the heading and outward references (§6 list, §8, §9) say "repulsion edge," but the body that actually defines and argues for the concept still says "scar" throughout. If the intent was a full rename, that body needs the same treatment (roughly 6 more occurrences). I did not do this because it wasn't asked and it's a judgment call about intended scope, not a mechanical one. Say the word and I'll finish it — it's a small, same-shape edit.

## Verification performed
- Read both files in full/relevant range before editing (edits succeeded — old_string matches confirmed by the tool, no silent no-ops).
- Confirmed via read of gavels G-13/G-26/G-27/G-38/G-43/G-44 per the trajectory seed's load order that these edits (git-tracked, cheap-undo, exact strings supplied) don't cross the mirror-turn threshold — undo cost is one `git diff`/revert, so I made the edits directly rather than staging a confirmation ceremony (G-27: ceremony weighted to reversibility; G-44: guard scales with undo-cost, not reading-confidence — and there was no ambiguous signal to read here, the task gave verbatim old/new text for edit 1).

## Remaining risk / manual check
- Confirm whether the §6.2 body-text rename (the ~6 remaining "scar" occurrences inside the section) was meant to be included. I left it out on purpose; easy to extend if not.
