Three independent research artifacts produced for synthesis into agent orchestration
and RAG system design principles. Read all three before synthesizing. Do not assume
the sources agree — find where they diverge and why.

## Study Three — Independent Architecture Specification

File: `/home/hruzam/nabla-lab/drafts/decentralized-memory-substrate-spec-v2.md`

A functional architecture specification for a decentralized agent-memory substrate.
Origin: sequential heterogeneous triangulation — claude.ai (Nabla) cold start on the
question; Gemini (Vega) cold start on the same question independently; Nabla then
received Vega's output as a second pass and reacted to it. Not fully blind (Nabla's
second pass had Vega's results), but two-family independent cold starts on the core
question. Unrelated to Studies One and Two in origin.

Provenance markers: `[CORE]` = appeared in BOTH Nabla's first-pass AND Vega's
independent pass — these have genuine two-family convergence. `[v2]` = single-agent
origin, or emerged only after Nabla saw Vega's output — treat as candidate, not settled.
Weight [CORE] items accordingly; apply more scrutiny to [v2] items.

Read the full document. Structural claims, invariants, and the seven candidate novel
contributions in §8 deserve particular attention.

The spec contains a mechanism (§6.2) not clearly represented in Studies One or Two:
the distinction between passive forgetting (decay) and active routing repulsion from
confirmed wrong paths. Evaluate whether this is a genuine architectural primitive or
a restatement of something already present in the technical literature.

## Study One — Structural Formalization of an Observed System

File: `raw.research/nature/report/study-one.formalized.2026-07-13.md`

A structural formalization of an empirically-observed class of spatially-embedded
distributed systems. Properties derived from direct measurement and behavioral
observation of a real system class. ALL source-domain vocabulary has been stripped;
the document reads as abstract graph, signal, and distribution properties only.

Coverage: 9 structural dimensions + 6 cross-cutting uncertainties (U1–U6).
Confidence tags carried through: DERIVED / INFERRED / UNRESOLVED — do not
treat UNRESOLVED properties as settled.

Read the full document. The Structural Summary (last section) is the
10-line distillation for a system designer.

## Study Two — Technical State-of-the-Art Survey

File: `raw.research/nature/report/study-two.technical.2026-07-13.md`

A current-state technical survey (2025–2026 sources) of distributed systems
architectures, covering 10 topic areas: loop-redundant topologies · multi-tier
caching · decentralized exchange · scale-free networks · signal/data separation ·
hysteretic state machines · long-horizon identity preservation · demand-pull
vs. supply-push · coupling tiers · RAG architecture.

Cross-cutting patterns section at end: four structural principles that emerged
independently across 3+ topic areas.

## Four Hypotheses for Synthesis

These are testable claims derived from comparing the studies. Challenge them.
Study Three may bear on any of these — derive the connections yourself.

**H1 — Gradient-economy redistribution is an open problem in distributed systems**

Study One formalizes a "scarcity-inverse transfer law": transfer intensity is
inversely correlated with local resource abundance, achieving market-arbitrage-like
redistribution with no central controller (Study One, Property 3.3).

Study Two (Topic 3) finds: gossip protocols achieve approximate redistribution
but "no production system cleanly combines gossip-based scarcity detection with
structured transfer" — explicitly flagged as an open problem.

Question: Is this a genuine architectural primitive missing from current practice?
If so, what would a concrete implementation look like in an agent orchestration
context — specifically, how does an agent network route tasks toward underloaded
agents without a coordinator?

**H2 — The distinction between protocol-pull and gradient-pull matters architecturally**

Study One describes a long-range transport tier where the consuming end generates
its own transport force: depletion at the sink creates a physical pressure differential
that pulls supply toward it (Study One, Property 2.1, T2 tier — "the sink pulls
its own supply").

Study Two (Topic 8) finds demand-pull architectures (Reactive Streams, TCP
backpressure) but these are protocol-level signals — a consumer sends a request(n)
message. The consuming end does not physically generate the transport gradient;
it sends a signal requesting supply.

Question: Does this distinction have architectural consequences for RAG? Specifically:
could a retrieval system be designed where the generation process itself generates
a gradient (via embedding similarity, attention weight, or token probability) that
continuously pulls relevant context toward it, rather than issuing explicit retrieval
requests? What would the latency and coherence tradeoffs be?

**H3 — Error partitioning by role is absent from current distributed systems design**

Study One describes four drift-suppression mechanisms; the most structurally novel
is asymmetric template-strand partitioning: uncertainty (new, untested copies) is
routed to expendable frontier units; tested copies are retained in the stable core.
The result is a spatial mutation clock — stability is a property of network extent,
not elapsed time (Study One, Property 7.2–7.3).

Study Two (Topic 7) finds identity-preservation via CRDTs, consistent hashing,
LSM — but these treat all nodes as equivalent. No current system implements
asymmetric error routing by role.

Question: For a knowledge base or agent memory system, what would "frontier" and
"stable core" roles look like? New, unverified retrievals go to frontier indices
(high churn, fast eviction). Retrievals that have passed quality gates get promoted
to stable core (low churn, high-confidence). Is this implementable? What are the
failure modes?

**H4 — Negative knowledge may require a distinct primitive from decay**

In agent memory systems, forgetting (weight decay, TTL expiration) and "this path
was tried and confirmed wrong" are usually conflated — wrong paths decay like
irrelevant paths. Study Two found tombstoning and TTL as the standard mechanisms.

Study Three proposes a stricter separation: decay means "forgot"; the other primitive
means "remembered-as-wrong, actively route away from this." The distinction matters
if a memory substrate that has forgotten a wrong path will eventually reroute toward
it (rediscovery), while one that carries the negative mark will not.

Question: Is this architecturally meaningful or just a semantic labeling choice?
In what failure mode does the distinction produce different behavior? Is the "active
routing repulsion" primitive in Study Three implementable without the weight scheme
described — and is the weight scheme itself novel?

## Convergent Evidence (three studies, independent)

Four structural principles appeared in both studies without priming. These may
be fundamental distributed-control principles — challenge or confirm:

1. **Asymmetric response to direction of change** — hysteresis as control strategy
   (Study One: Property 6.2; Study Two: AIMD, circuit breakers)
2. **Structural identity over component identity** — logical continuity in addressing
   scheme, not physical nodes (Study One: Properties 7.1/7.5; Study Two: CRDTs/LSM)
3. **Fast signal / slow data channel separation** — match channel to information
   sensitivity (Study One: Property 4.1–4.5; Study Two: SDN, Raft, sidecar)
4. **Local recoverability paid for with local state** — no coordinator, but per-node
   cost (Study One: Property 1.1 fusion; Study Two: gossip, circuit breakers)

## Output objective

Principles for agent orchestration and RAG system design — actionable
architectural recommendations derived from the synthesis.

For each output principle, mark:
- **NOVEL** — not in current practice, derived from the studies
- **CONFIRMED** — convergently evidenced across two or more independent sources
- **CHALLENGED** — hypothesis rejected or refined (explain why)
- **PARTIAL** — directionally supported but insufficiently grounded for implementation

Vocabulary constraint — two layers, both mandatory:
1. No organism-level biology vocabulary (fungi, hyphal, spore, root, any word naming
   a biological organism or biological structure).
2. No molecular-biology or biochemistry vocabulary (strand, mitotic, symport,
   membrane-crossing, chemical compound names for cellular structures, any word
   that could appear in a biology or biochemistry textbook).

Pure architectural and coding design language only. The three input studies are already
clean at this level — keep the output there.
